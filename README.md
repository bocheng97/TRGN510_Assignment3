# These are python scripts for regex practice.
## The gtf2json.py's file is Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz, from http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens using wget
## The grep.sh is how I pre-treat the gtf file, because the gtf file is exactly txt files, so I convert it to txt and also delet lines starting with #.
